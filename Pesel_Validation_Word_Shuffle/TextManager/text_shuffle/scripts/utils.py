    Shuffle the characters inside words of the given text while keeping 
    the starting and ending punctuation intact.

    Args:
    text (str): The text to be processed, where each word will be modified 
                by shuffling its inner characters.

    Returns:
    str: The text with shuffled words, where the starting and ending 
         punctuation of each word is preserved.

    During processing:
    - Each word is checked for leading and trailing punctuation.
    - Words shorter than 3 characters remain unchanged.
    - Words longer than 3 characters have their internal characters shuffled randomly.
    - Empty words (resulting from consecutive spaces) are removed.

    Example:
    >>> shuffle_words_with_punctuation("Hello, world! This is a test.")
    "Hleol, wdorl! Tihs is a tset."
